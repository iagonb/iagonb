### Hi, I'm Iago 👋 🧑‍

I'm a PhD candidate in Physics with a background in complex systems, statistical physics, and econophysics. My work sits at the intersection of theory, computation, and data science.

I’m particularly interested in stochastic processes, network-based models, and economical phenomena, combining analytical approaches (SDEs, Fokker–Planck equations) with large-scale simulations in Python, C and Fortran.

Here you’ll find repositories related to:

📊 Data Science & Analytics (risk, finance, and applied modeling)

🔬 Agent-based and stochastic models

🌐 Complex networks and emergent phenomena

🧠 Bridging physics-inspired models with real-world data

I enjoy tackling complex, multidisciplinary problems and turning theory into reproducible code 🚀

🛠️ Tools

Python | C | Fortran 90 | Linux | R | SQL | LaTeX
